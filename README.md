# Cloudformation-CFN-HUB
Cloudformation template to update the host file in any EC2 instances started by an AutoScaling Group

We can define several files that contain hooks monitoring several resources. Letâ€™s examine the hook defined in /etc/cfn/hooks.d/cfn-auto-reloader.conf.

This hook monitors  Resources.EcsInstanceLaunchConfiguration.Metadata.AWS::CloudFormation::Init,  

so any changes to the metadata of this launch configuration. When anything changes, it executes the command /opt/aws/bin/cfn-init --verbose --stack=${AWS::StackName} --region=${AWS::Region} --resource=EcsInstanceLaunchConfiguration --configsets UpdateEnvironment

Which updates the host file with the private IP address of the Graylog instance.
